Google opóźniało zamknięcie operacji szpiegowskiej Catwatchful, która hostowała tajne oprogramowanie na własnych serwerach, monitorując tysiące telefonów. W międzyczasie na cyberprzestępczym forum Leak Zone wyciekły dane użytkowników, a firmy alarmują o rosnącej liczbie ataków łańcuchowych na open-source’owe pakiety. Nowe kampanie phishingowe i cyberespionage prowadzone przez grupy takie jak Patchwork czy Fire Ant ukazują skalę zagrożeń w globalnej cyberprzestrzeni, obejmując zarówno Turcję, Rosję, jak i Koreę Północną. Równocześnie badania wykazują, że AI wspomaga rozwój coraz bardziej wyrafinowanego malware, takiego jak Koske, które potrafi ukrywać się nawet w popularnych obrazach, czy CastleLoader rozprzestrzeniający się przez fałszywe repozytoria na GitHub. Eksperci alarmują także o lukach w infrastrukturalnych systemach bezpieczeństwa, takich jak niedawne krytyczne błędy w Mitel i SonicWall, które mogą pozwalać atakującym na pełny dostęp do krytycznych systemów komunikacyjnych i chmur.
